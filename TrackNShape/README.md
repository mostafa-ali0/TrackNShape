# TrackNShape

## Project Info

**TrackNShape** is your ultimate *nutrition* and *fitness* key. Beyond just regular old simple fitness tracking, it also
functions as your own personalized nutritional guide, simplifying your fitness and health goals with accuracy and ease. 
This application is designed to work with a wide range of individuals, including athletes, weight-loss warriors, and 
individuals looking to live a more health-conscious lifestyle. TrackNShape empowers you to manage your dietary choices, 
monitor food macronutrients, and navigate your nutritional journey towards a dreamy healthy lifestyle.

My enthusiasm for this project comes from my unapologetic mindset to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I strongly believe
that this project has the ability to assist individuals akin to myself, who place a strong emphasis on their health as a
non-negotiable. It not only promotes awareness about nutrition but also offers the exceptional convenience of planning 
crucial health and fitness data within this user beginner-friendly application.

Project Reflection:
If I had more time to work on the project: 
- I would reduce coupling of classes in the ui package
- I would structure JFrame elements better so that not most would have local scope
- I would make an interface for window classes as there is alot of repeated code
